Social Media Usage by U.S. Adults
by Dane Jones, Andrew Batista, and Anais Reneaum Lavoie

## Summary

To better understand Americans’ social media use, Pew Research Center 
surveyed 5,022 U.S. adults from May 19 to Sept. 5, 2023. Ipsos conducted 
a National Public Opinion Reference Survey for the Center using 
address-based sampling and a multimode protocol that included both 
web and mail. That way, nearly all U.S. adults had a chance of selection. 
The survey was weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population 
by gender, race and ethnicity, and other categories.

Our goal for our project was to explore trends in the popularity of various 
social media platforms among U.S. adults over time. By examining changes in 
user engagement across platforms, our project aims to understand how digital 
behaviors and communication preferences have shifted over the past decade. 
Our research question is: How has social media usage evolved from 2012-2024, 
and what patterns can be seen across different platforms?

We utilized three different bar charts to show the differences in
different demographic groups across platforms, and also to see 
the growth of usage rate in across platforms over time. 

Our first bar chart shows the percentage of U.S. adults using each 
platform, broken down by racial group. Asian and Hispanic adults show 
the highest overall engagement on video and photo driven platforms- 
49% of Hispanic adults use TikTok and 93% of Asian adults use Youtube, 
while White adults show stronger usage on Pinterest and Facebook- 
36% and 69% respectively. Black adults exhibit consistently high use of 
TikTok (39%) and Youtube (82%), reflecting different community based 
content interests compared to other groups.

Our second bar chart shows the percentage of U.S. adults using each
platform by gender. Women dominate usage on platforms centered around 
lifestyle, creativity, and personal sharing- Tiktok (40%), Pinterest (50%), 
Instagram (54%), and Facebook (76%). Men show higher participation 
in discussion based platforms with text forward interfaces- Reddit (27%), 
Twitter (26%), LinkedIn (31%). These differences suggest that platform 
design strongly influences which demographic groups remain most active.

Our last bar chart shows the percentage of U.S. adults who report 
ever using each platform, shown from 2012-2024. Each facet represents 
a single platform, allowing clear comparison of how activity rises 
(or declines) across survey years. Missing years reflect platforms 
that did not yet exist or were not included in early surveys. YouTube, 
Facebook, and Instagram have remained consistently high engagement 
platforms over the past decade, while newer platforms such as TikTok, 
Reddit, and BeReal show clear upward trajectories. Longer established 
platforms like Twitter (now X) show flatter or decreasing usage, 
reflecting shifts in digital patterns and platform relevance over time.
